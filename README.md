WeSwapp API
=========


WeSwapp is a service that allows you to trade real-life objects within a local community.

It is based on trust and relies on Facebook to enforce that trust.

WeSwapp is born out of a hackathon in Sherbrooke, QC in November 2013.

It has won us the second place in the competition.
